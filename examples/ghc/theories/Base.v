Lemma forallb_imp:
  forall a P Q (xs : list a),
  forallb P xs = true ->
  (forall x, P x = true -> Q x = true) ->
  forallb Q xs = true.
Proof.
  induction xs; simpl; intros; auto.
  apply andb_prop in H.
  apply andb_true_intro.
  intuition.
Qed.


Lemma forM_map:
  forall (m : Type -> Type) (a b c : Type) `{Monad m}
  (xs : list a) (act : b -> m c) (f : a -> b),
  Traversable.forM (map f xs) act = Traversable.forM xs (fun x => act (f x)).
Proof.
  intros.
  induction xs.
  * reflexivity.
  * cbv. f_equal. apply IHxs.
Qed.

Lemma forM_cong:
  forall {a m b} `{Monad m} (f g : a -> m b) (xs : list a),
  (forall x, In x xs -> f x = g x) ->
  Traversable.forM xs f = Traversable.forM xs g.
Proof.
  intros.
  rewrite <- forM_map with (act := fun x => x) (f := f).
  rewrite <- forM_map with (act := fun x => x) (f := g).
  f_equal.
  apply map_ext_in.
