 - no unboxed ints
   See Num.v.  This is doable if we
	  (a) use Z for Int#
	  (b) translate identifiers so that they don't include #
	  (c) use notations for every identifier mentioning a # (optional)

 - cannot skip names containing # (shiftL#)
   FIXED

 - bug in eqString output (precedence in parsing? or pp?)
     (eqString (andb (c1 == c2) cs1) cs2)

- bug in precedence with $ and ++
  Enum/succError Enum/predError

- also precedence bug (orb & -) with Unicode/isSpace and with $

 - (->) as a type constructor

 - (.*.) as a variable name in Data.Function (!!)

- rename infix constructor to prefix constructor doesn't work for pattern
  matching (still infix)
